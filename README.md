# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic approach of how a software is developed
importances
.Improving efficiency by automating tasks
.Improving security by making sure that data being transfered is securely transferred to the needed user
.Allowing fast and reliable data transfer. examples like one can send a message to a person anywhere in the world within seconds.
.Enabling the creation of innovative solutions that transform industries and improve lives

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
.The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s):
where by, This period was defined by the "software crisis," where software projects frequently exceeded budgets, missed deadlines, and produced unreliable software. The need for proper software designs was needed due to the complexity of the software.
. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s):
where by, Object-oriented programming revolutionized software design by introducing the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data and behavior. Languages like C++ and Java gained prominence, enabling developers to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
. The Internet Age and Agile Methodologies (Late 1990s-2000s):
where by, The rise of the internet and the World Wide Web transformed software development, leading to the creation of web applications and distributed systems. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emerged as a response to the need for faster and more flexible development processes. This is also when cloud computing came to life.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
. Planning: This is when the reason of why or what is being developed arises.
. Requirements Analysis: This is gathering the functional and non-functional requiremnts of the software to be developed.
. Design: In this phase, the software's architecture and design are created based on the requirements. This includes designing the user interface, database, and system architecture.
. Implementation (Coding): This is where the actual coding of the software takes place. The developers write code based on the systems requirements.
. Testing: This is very crucial and helps to find and fix bugs or defects of a software.
. Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested, it is deployed to the production environment. This means we make it visible to the end users.
. Maintenance: This ongoing phase involves providing support and updates to the software after it has been deployed.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
